# ECOMMERCE-SHIPPING-PREDICTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
This project aims to predict the shipping time for ecommerce orders using various machine learning techniques. The prediction models have been implemented using Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prachi13/customer-analytics?select=Train.csv) used for training and testing the models contains information about ecommerce orders and their corresponding shipping times.

# Dataset Description
The dataset consists of information about ecommerce orders, including features such as order date, delivery date, shipping address, product category, weight, dimensions, shipping method, etc. The target variable is the shipping time, which represents the number of days it takes for an order to be delivered after it is placed.

# Instructions to Run
To run the prediction models, execute the respective Python scripts using any Python environment or IDE. Make sure to have the required libraries installed, such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (for ANN, CNN, and RNN), and any additional libraries specified in the scripts.

# Results
After running the prediction models, the performance of each model will be evaluated and displayed. The evaluation metrics used may include Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, R-squared score, etc. These metrics will provide insights into the accuracy and effectiveness of each model in predicting shipping times for ecommerce orders.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of various machine learning techniques for predicting shipping times in ecommerce. By comparing the results of different models, we can identify the most suitable approach for accurately predicting shipping times, which can help ecommerce businesses optimize their logistics and improve customer satisfaction.

# Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during the execution of the Python scripts or need further assistance, feel free to contact the project owner or open an issue on the project's GitHub repository.
